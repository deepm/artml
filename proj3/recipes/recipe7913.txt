Recipe By:Jenn Hall "The muffins you get from this recipe using all-purpose and whole wheat flour are great while still warm from the oven!" Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon whole wheat flour 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons milk 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 7/8 egg Directions Heat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease bottoms only of 12 muffin cups or line with baking cups. In a medium bowl, combine flours, sugar, baking powder and salt; mix well. In a small bowl, combine milk, oil and egg; blend well. Add dry ingredients all at once; stir just until dry ingredients are moistened (batter will be lumpy.) Fill cups 2/3 full. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 1 minute before removing from pan. Serve warm.
