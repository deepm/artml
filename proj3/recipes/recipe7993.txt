Recipe By:Sally "Delicious! The combination of mint and chocolate is always a sure-fire pleaser." Ingredients For the Cake Layer: 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3-1/4 eggs, room temperature 13 ounces chocolate syrup 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-2/3 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon creme de menthe liqueur 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon semisweet chocolate chips 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon butter Directions Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 13x 9-inch baking pan. Cream 1/2 cup butter with 1 cup white sugar. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing after each until fully incorporated. Stir in the chocolate syrup and vanilla. Mix in the flour and salt; stir until just combined. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a tester comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Let cake cool completely before frosting. To Make Mint Layer: Combine the confectioners' sugar and 1/2 cup butter; beat with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour in the creme de menthe syrup; blend until incorporated. Spread over the top of the cooled cake. To Make The Chocolate Glaze: Melt the chocolate chips and 6 tablespoons butter together over low heat or in a microwave, stirring every 30 seconds. Let cool slightly, then spread over top of the mint layer. Chill cake for at least 3 hours or overnight. Cut into small blocks to serve. Keep cake refrigerated.
