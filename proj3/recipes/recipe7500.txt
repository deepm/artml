Recipe By:Joan "This is my son's favorite cake. It stays very moist. I usually frost it with cream cheese frosting, but it is also great plain. It can also be baked in 2 loaf pans for zucchini bread." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 1-1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1-1/4 eggs, lightly beaten 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon grated zucchini 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 13x9-inch baking pan. Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, and cinnamon in a bowl and set aside. In a separate bowl, mix the eggs, oil, sugar, grated zucchini, and vanilla. Add the flour mixture to the zucchini mixture and stir until just combined. Stir in the chopped nuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.
