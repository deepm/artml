Recipe By:PEDGI "This is a moist banana bread recipe that I make fairly often with leftover, very ripe bananas." Ingredients 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon honey 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-3/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon mashed bananas 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon hot water 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, beat oil and honey together. Add eggs, and mix well. Stir in bananas and vanilla. Stir in flour and salt. Add baking soda to hot water, stir to mix, and then add to batter. Blend in chopped nuts. Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool on wire rack for 1/2 hour before slicing.
