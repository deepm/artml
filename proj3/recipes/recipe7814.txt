Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake layer pans. Combine the cake mix, instant vanilla pudding, milk, vegetable oil and the 3 whole eggs. Mix until blended. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until cakes test done. Set aside cakes to cool.
