Put in oven with a bowl of hot water on bottom shelf. Inside a gas oven with a pilot light is ideal." Ingredients 7/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons shortening 1 cup and 1 tablespoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1-3/4 teaspoons salt 2-1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 2-1/2 teaspoons butter, melted Directions Mix together shortening, sugar, salt, yeast, and 1 1/5 cups flour. Add warm water and beat by hand about 300 strokes, or 3 minutes, with an electric mixer. Add remaining flour, scraping bowl often, and mix all together until smooth. Cover with a clean cloth and let rise until doubled in volume. Stir dough down gently, and spoon into a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan (the batter should be sticky).
