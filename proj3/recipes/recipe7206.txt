Recipe By:Sandy "This recipe is from my mom. Makes a very crusty bread. You can substitute half of the flour amount with whole wheat flour." Ingredients 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1-1/4 teaspoons white sugar 1-1/4 teaspoons salt 3-1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1-1/4 teaspoons cornmeal 1-1/4 teaspoons sesame seeds (optional) 2-1/2 teaspoons cold water Directions In a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm water or potato water. Add sugar and salt and mix well. Stir in 7 cups of the flour. On a well-floured surface, knead dough for 7 minutes, incorporating in the last cup of flour. Place dough in a greased bowl. Let rise until doubled. Using a lightly floured board, form dough into 2 long or round loaves. Sprinkle cornmeal on greased baking sheet; place loaves on top. Slash top with a sharp knife. Cover, and let rise until almost doubled. Brush top of loaves with cold water. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if desired. Place in a cold oven. Turn oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake for 45 minutes, or until nicely browned. Brush twice during baking time with cold water.
