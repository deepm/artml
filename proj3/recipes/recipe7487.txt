Recipe By:Jean Higginbotham "This is a pure white wedding cake frosting. You can double the recipe if you have a sturdy mixer. Add milk according to purpose; you need less if you are making flowers or borders than if you are just covering a cake. Remove what you need for decorating before you thin the rest down for frosting." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 3-1/3 cups confectioners' sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon milk 1-1/4 teaspoons almond extract Directions Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl.
