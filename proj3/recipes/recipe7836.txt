Recipe By:J M Thomas "I'm glad my mother gave me this recipe. I think it's better than regular pumpkin pie, because it doesn't have a really strong pumpkin taste." Ingredients 1-1/4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 5/8 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1-1/4 eggs 1/8 teaspoon salt 1-1/4 prepared 8 inch pastry shells Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat together the cream cheese and the sugar, add the pumpkin and the spices. Beat in eggs one at a time. Add salt. Beat until creamy. Pour the batter evenly into the two pastry shells. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 minutes or until the knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Let cool then top with whipped topping, if desired.
