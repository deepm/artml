Recipe By:Kaniska "Cake with a difference. You do not have to cream butter and sugar or beat the eggs. This involves boiling raisins, margarine and sugar together and adding flour to it. Simple and tasty. Just the way I love it." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon turbinado sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon raisins 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon water 1-1/4 cups whole wheat flour 7/8 pinch ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon baking powder Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 7x7 inch square baking pan. Boil sugar, raisins, butter, and the water until the raisins absorb most of the water and are quite soggy and mushy. Set aside and let cool completely. Sift the flour, cinnamon, and the baking powder together. Stir the flour mixture into the raisin mixture and mix until just combined. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 to 45 minutes or until cake springs back upon the touch. Immediately put on a wire rack to cool. This is a very soft cake, liable to break easily. Take care when you cut the cake. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
