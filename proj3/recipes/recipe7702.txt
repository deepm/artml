Recipe By:Carol "This cake is for those of you who have allergies. When my kids were small they developed an allergy against all dairy products, and then gradually outgrew them." Ingredients 1 cup packed brown sugar 1 cup water 1/3 cup shortening 1 cup raisins 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 1/4 cups sifted cake flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 cup sliced almonds (optional) 1 teaspoon almond extract (optional) Directions Combine the sugar, water, shortening, raisins, spices, and salt in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and stir while cooking for 3 minutes. Cool. Measure flour, soda, and baking powder, and sift together. Gradually stir dry ingredients into raisin mixture. Beat well. If an almond cake is desired, stir in almond extract and almonds. Pour batter into a greased 8 x 4 inch loaf pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for about 1 hour.
