Recipe By:Susan "Quick, easy, and refreshing. Use any flavor ice cream. If you use sherbet or sorbet, it can be a very low-fat dessert." Ingredients 7/8 (10 inch) angel food cake 6-2/3 cups strawberry ice cream Directions Take ice cream out of freezer to soften. It should be easy to spread and not melted. Rip the angel food cake into chunks (about 2 inches). Place a layer of cake on the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Spread a layer of the softened ice cream on top. Repeat layers until cake and ice cream are gone. Put cake in freezer for at least 2 to 3 hours. When ready to serve remove cake from freezer and place cake onto a serving dish, removing pan.
