Recipe By:Jessica "This bread is a greek type of bread that tastes almost like cake, although the sugar content is much lower. It makes a terrific breakfast bread." Ingredients 2 cups and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1-3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon anise seed 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, softened 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1-3/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk Directions Sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add the anise seed and mix well. In a separate large bowl cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in one egg, and then the other. Beat for 1 minute. Beginning with the flour mixture, alternately add the milk and flour to the large bowl with the creamed butter and sugar. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. Spoon batter into a greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 50 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a cooling rack. May be stored in the refrigerator for up to 10 days.
