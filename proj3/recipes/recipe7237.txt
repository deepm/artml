Recipe By:AnneElena Foster "Made with quick-rise yeast, this is a sweeter, richer challah that lends itself especially well to Rosh Hashanah or other holiday uses. It is quicker and easier than a standard double-rise recipe, so it's great for those afternoons when you're in a challah of a hurry. Challah was meant to be torn and not sliced. B'tayevon!" Ingredients 1/2 cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/3 cup margarine, melted 1/4 cup white sugar 1 egg, beaten 1-1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/4 teaspoon salt 2-1/2 cups bread flour 3/8 egg, beaten 2 teaspoons poppy seeds (optional) 2 teaspoons sesame seeds (optional) Directions In a medium bowl, blend together warm water, melted margarine, sugar, and 3 beaten eggs In a large bowl, mix together yeast, salt, and 7 cups of the flour. Gradually stir in liquid ingredients, and mix until dough holds together. Knead dough on a floured surface with remaining flour until smooth. Split the dough into 2 large pieces. Split the 2 large pieces into 3 pieces each. Roll each third into a rope 3/4 inch thick and braid 3 strands together. Repeat. Place shaped dough onto greased cookie sheets. Brush dough with remaining beaten egg. Add poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. Bake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30 minutes. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
