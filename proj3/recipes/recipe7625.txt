Recipe By:Carol "This is a very good frosting. You may flavor it with any flavoring extract to suit your needs." Ingredients 1-1/2 cups white sugar 1/2 cup water 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar 1-1/2 egg whites 1/2 pinch salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Combine sugar, water, and cream of tartar in a saucepan. Cook until candy thermometer reaches 238 degrees F (115 degrees C), or until syrup spins a long thread when dripped from a spoon. Beat egg whites until stiff. Pour a thin, slow stream of the syrup into egg whites, beating constantly until frosting stands in peaks. Stir in salt and vanilla to taste.
