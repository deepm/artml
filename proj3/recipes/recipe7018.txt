Recipe By:Laura Owen "I make this delicious French toast on snow days. I use cinnamon-raisin English muffins rather than bread, with great results. Serve with warm maple syrup." Ingredients 6-3/4 eggs 1-2/3 cups milk 3/4 teaspoon salt 1-3/4 teaspoons ground nutmeg 20 slices raisin bread 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 3-1/3 cups white sugar Directions Mix eggs, milk, salt, and nutmeg together with a fork, until the whole mixture is pale yellow. Pour this into a low, flat pan or a large, shallow dish. If you are using English muffins, cut them in half so that you have six halves. Let the halves or the slices of bread soak on each side in the egg mixture. Spread a layer of granulated sugar on a plate, and dip both sides of the bread in sugar. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Put about half a tablespoon of butter in the pan, and let it melt. Place two muffin halves or slices of bread in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Wipe old butter out of pan, and repeat with remaining slices of bread. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
