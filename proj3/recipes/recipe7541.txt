Recipe By:Leta Harris "This cake is the best cinnamon cake I have ever made. Every time I serve it, the compliments never end. Serve it warm, about 45 minutes out of the oven, for an even greater pleasure." Ingredients 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 2-1/4 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon shortening 3/4 cup and 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2-1/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon milk 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon butter 3 tablespoons and 2-1/2 teaspoons water 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and lightly flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Stir together the flour, baking powder, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, beat shortening, 1 1/3 cups white sugar and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating for at least 1 minute after each egg. Beat in the flour mixture alternately with the milk. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack. Remove cake from pan while it is still warm, and poke holes around the top of the cake with a fork. Pour the warm cinnamon syrup into the holes and onto the top and sides of the cake. To Make Cinnamon Syrup: In a saucepan, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, butter, water, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon. Heat and stir until butter melts.
