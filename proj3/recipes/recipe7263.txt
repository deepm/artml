Recipe By:Mary "This is great for brunches or family get-togethers, or just any ol' time. It is really good when still warm. I make this cake for Christmas and Easter breakfast when family and friends are here." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 1-2/3 cups white sugar 3-1/4 eggs 1-2/3 cups sour cream 1-3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 3-1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1-3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1-3/4 teaspoons baking soda 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1-3/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 cup and 3 tablespoons chopped walnuts Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. In a medium bowl, mix the flour, baking powder and baking soda together and set aside. In a separate small bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, cinnamon, and nuts. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter and 2 cups white sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, sour cream, and vanilla extract. Add flour mixture and beat until well combined. Pour half of batter into Bundt pan. Sprinkle half of the nut mixture on top of batter in pan. Add remaining batter, and sprinkle with the last of the nut mixture.
