Grease and flour two 8 inch round pans. Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl. Cream butter and sugar together in a mixing bowl. Add egg yolks and vanilla; beat until fluffy. Add milk to butter mixture in 2 parts alternately with flour mixture in 3 parts, beginning and ending with flour mixture. Spread in prepared pans.
