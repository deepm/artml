Recipe By:Stephanie "A thin pumpkin cake, rolled around in a white cream filling, then in nuts. Can be frozen and served chilled. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired." Ingredients 2 eggs 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon canned pumpkin 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1-1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 3/4 cup and 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts 1/4 pound cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons butter, softened 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a mixing bowl, beat eggs on high for 5 minutes. Gradually beat in white sugar until thick and lemon-colored. Add pumpkin and lemon juice. In another bowl combine flour, cinnamon, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg; fold into the pumpkin mixture. Grease a 15x10x1 inch baking pan; line with waxed paper. Grease and flour the paper. Spread batter into pan; sprinkle with walnuts. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 15 minutes or until cake springs back when lightly touched. Immediately turn out onto a linen towel dusted with confectioners' sugar. Peel off paper and roll cake up in the towel, starting with the short end. Cool. Meanwhile, in a mixing bowl, beat cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners' sugar, butter, and vanilla until fluffy. Carefully unroll the cake. Spread filling over cake to within 1 inch of edges. Roll up again. Cover and chill until serving. Dust with additional confectioners' sugar, if desired. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
