Recipe By:Holly Liddiard "My Mom used to make this and I still make this pudding-like cake. During the baking the batter rises to the top and a pudding like sauce forms underneath the crust. There is also a lemon version." Ingredients 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/3 cup white sugar 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup milk 1 cup packed brown sugar 2 cups boiling water 1 tablespoon butter 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 2 quart casserole dish. Sift the flour, white sugar and baking powder together. Add the raisins and stir in the milk. Spoon batter into the prepared dish. Combine the brown sugar, boiling water, butter and vanilla. Gently pour over the batter. Do not stir. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Serve warm.
