Recipe By:Dee Turner "This moist chocolate cake from my grandma is glazed with lemon icing in an unusually great combination." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 1 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 1-3/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon hot water 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1-1/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 3/4 teaspoon lemon zest 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon lemon juice Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and line with parchment paper one 9 inch round cake pan. Cream shortening, add white sugar gradually and cream until fluffy. Blend in the well beaten eggs. In a separate bowl, slowly add hot water to cocoa and mix until smooth, dissolving cocoa completely. In a third bowl, sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder; add to creamed mixture alternately with the cocoa mixture. Blend in vanilla. Pour batter into one 9 inch round pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes or until cake tester comes out clean. Let cake cool then ice with Lemon Icing. To Make Icing: Combine confectioner's sugar with enough lemon juice to make the icing spreadable without being runny or stiff (about 1/4 cup). Stir in the grated zest. Pour icing over top of cake. See the full moon.
