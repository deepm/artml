Recipe By:Karin Christian "This cheesecake is creamier than most cheesecakes, and very easy to make. Use grated lemon zest or 1 teaspoon lemon extract for flavoring." Ingredients 7/8 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker crust 13 ounces cream cheese 1-3/4 eggs 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1-3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat softened cream cheese slightly. Add eggs, sugar, vanilla, and lemon zest. Beat until light and fluffy. Pour mixture into crust. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until firm, about 25 minutes. Let cheesecake cool then top with cherry or blueberry pie filling, if desired. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours before serving.
