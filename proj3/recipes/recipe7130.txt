Recipe By:Leanne "A light, high volume bread machine bread. It works well when you use the Dough selection, and allow the bread to rise in a bread pan." Ingredients 1 cup and 1 tablespoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons margarine 2 cups and 1 tablespoon bread flour 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon oat bran 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons honey 3/4 teaspoon salt 1-1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast Directions Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select the Dough setting, and Start. After the dough has risen once, remove it from the machine. Knead it a few times, and then shape into a loaf. Place in a greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until done. Alternatively, choose the Basic or White Bread setting, and Start.
