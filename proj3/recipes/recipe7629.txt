Recipe By:Carol "This is a long procedure, but well worth the trouble. A great cake. Makes about 11 pounds." Ingredients 3 tablespoons and 1/2 teaspoon golden raisins 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon dried currants 1 tablespoon and 1/2 teaspoon orange zest 1/2 ounce candied lemon peel 2-1/2 teaspoons chopped candied citron 1-1/4 teaspoons candied angelica 1-1/4 teaspoons red candied cherries 1-1/4 teaspoons green candied cherries 1-3/4 teaspoons brandy 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon sifted all-purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon ground mace 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon butter, softened 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 eggs, separated 1/8 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 1-1/4 teaspoons sherry 1 tablespoon and 1/2 teaspoon sherry Directions Place raisins and currants in a bowl, and add enough water to just cover them. Soak overnight. Chop orange and lemon peel quite fine; do the same with the citron, angelica, and both types of cherries. Pour 1/2 cup brandy over fruit, and allow to stand overnight. Sift together flour, mace, and nutmeg. Beat egg yolks until thick and light, then beat in 1 cup of sugar a little at a time. Stir in lemon juice. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. In a large bowl, cream the butter, and then add 1 cup sugar a little at a time; beat until smooth. Combine yolk mixture with creamed mixture. Add flour and 1/3 cup sherry alternately to the creamed mixture. Stir in all the fruit, and fold in stiffly beaten egg whites. Pour batter into a well greased and floured 10 inch mold or tube pan. This cake can also be made in 2 large loaf pans. Place a pan of hot water in the bottom of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven. Place cake pans in oven, and bake about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C); continue baking 100 minutes for large cake, or 40 minutes for loaf cakes. Cakes are done when a toothpick comes out dry. Turn cake(s) out on rack to cool. Wrap cake(s) in cheesecloth soaked in sherry, and store in airtight container for a month or more. If the cheesecloth dries out in the mellowing period soak it again with the same spirits, and rewrap the cake. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
