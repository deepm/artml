Recipe By:Suzanne Stull "Very light pound cake. Tastes just like Sara Lee's!" Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 2-1/2 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon cake flour 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons dry milk powder 2-1/2 teaspoons corn syrup 3/8 lemon, juiced 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon ground mace (optional) Directions Allow butter to reach room temperature. Cream sugar and butter together until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time and mix well. Add in flour, powdered milk, and corn syrup. Beat each in well. Add juice of half a lemon, salt, vanilla, nutmeg and mace. Make sure everything is well blended, and pour into a greased loaf pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 45 minutes, checking for doneness by inserting a toothpick and seeing if it comes out clean. You almost want to underbake this.
