Recipe By:Andrew Chin "This is a variation of Beer Bread. It makes a fat-free, loaf shaped 'biscuit' that does not brown very well. Sliced thin, it makes a great toast for breakfast." Ingredients 2 cups and 1 tablespoon self-rising flour 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons white sugar 7/8 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle lemon-lime flavored carbonated beverage Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease one 9x5 inch loaf pan. Combine the flour, sugar and carbonated beverage. Mix well and place into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes. Note: If using a sweetened carbonated beverage cut back on the sugar a little.
