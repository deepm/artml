Recipe By:Barbara "This cake is a very moist banana cake that travels well to pot lucks or picnics. It can also be baked in a 9x13 pan or an angel food cake pan. It is a family favorite." Ingredients 7/8 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix 7/8 (3.5 ounce) package instant banana pudding mix 3-1/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon water 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons mashed bananas 1-2/3 cups confectioners' sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons milk 7/8 dash vanilla extract 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts (optional) Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. In a large bowl, stir together cake mix and pudding mix. Make a well in the center and pour in eggs, water, oil and mashed banana. Beat on low speed until blended. Scrape bowl, and beat 4 minutes on medium speed. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in a preheated oven for 50 to 55 minutes, or until cake tests done. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. To make glaze: In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, milk and vanilla. Whisk until smooth and of a drizzling consistency. When cake is cooled, drizzle icing over cake with a zigzag motion. Sprinkle chopped nuts over wet icing if desired.
