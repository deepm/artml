Recipe By:Cathy "This is a very old recipe and it seems like there are a lot of ingredients, but it is worth the effort. I use the extra whipping cream to decorate the top of the cheesecake." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon ground pecans 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons brown sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons canned pumpkin 2-1/2 egg yolks 1-1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground mace 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon salt 2-1/2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 7/8 egg 7/8 egg yolk 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons whipping cream 2-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine the graham cracker crumbs, ground pecans, 2 tablespoons white sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and the melted butter or margarine and mix well. Firmly press mixture into one 9 inch springform pan. Combine 3/4 cup of the white sugar, the pumpkin, 3 egg yolks, ground cinnamon, ground mace, ground ginger and salt in a medium bowl. Mix well, and set aside. Beat cream cheese with an electric mixer until light and fluffy; gradually add 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar and mix well. Add the whole egg, remaining egg yolk and the whipping cream, beating well. Add cornstarch and vanilla and lemon flavorings, beat batter until smooth. Add pumpkin mixture and mix well. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 55 minutes. Do not overbake. Center may be soft but it will firm up when chilled. Let cheesecake cool on a wire rack, then refrigerate. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
