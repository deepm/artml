Ingredients 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon margarine 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon margarine 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon raisins Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
