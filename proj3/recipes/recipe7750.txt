Recipe By:Suzanne Stull "Very good, simple cake to make. Always gets a lot of attention." Ingredients 7/8 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix 1 cup and 1 tablespoon water 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 2-1/2 egg whites 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon chocolate sandwich cookie crumbs 2-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons shortening 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-3/4 egg whites 10 chocolate sandwich cookies Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, mix the cake mix, water, oil, and 3 egg whites with an electric mixer on high speed for 2 minutes. Gently stir in crushed cookies. Pour batter into the prepared pans. Bake for 25 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes in pans. Remove from pans, and completely cool on racks. To Make Frosting: In a small bowl, thoroughly blend the 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, shortening, vanilla, and 2 egg whites. Beat in remaining confectioners' sugar until creamy. Frost the cake, and garnish with remaining cookies.
