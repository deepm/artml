Recipe By:Karin Christian "These are a delicious cross between a roll and a biscuit. You roll them out like a biscuit, and they rise like a roll." Ingredients 3/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 2 cups and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1-1/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon white sugar 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon shortening Directions In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 5 minutes. Add buttermilk to yeast mixture, and set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in yeast mixture until dry ingredients are moistened. Turn dough out onto a floured surface, and knead 4 or 5 times. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut out biscuits with a 2 1/2 inch round cutter. Place on lightly greased baking sheets, barely touching each other. Cover, and let rise in a warm place free from drafts for 1 hour, or until almost doubled in size. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 12 minutes, or until browned. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
