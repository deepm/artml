Recipe By:Dee "The dough will look resemble a batter, almost pourable. Take care not to add too much flour. If using all-purpose flour, use a little less as it is heavier than bread flour. Great to eat hot from the oven with butter." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 2-1/2 teaspoons white sugar 1-3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1-1/4 teaspoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups and 1 tablespoon bread flour 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons cornmeal Directions In a small bowl stir together the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Stir to dissolve and set aside. In a large bowl dissolve baking soda with the 1 1/2 teaspoons warm water. Add the warm milk, salt, and one cup of the flour. Beat with a wire whisk until smooth. Beat in yeast mixture and remaining flour. Batter should be thick, sticky, and smooth. Prepare 2 pie pans with non-stick spray. Dust pans with cornmeal. Place 1/2 dough in each pie pan. Batter will spread during rising time. Spray top of dough with non-stick cooking spray. Cover and let rise for one hour. Repeat spraying of bread with non-stick cooking spray. Bake in a preheated 375 degree F (190 degrees C) for 20 minutes. Allow to cool for an hour before slicing. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
