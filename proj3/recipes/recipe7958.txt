Recipe By:Carol "The chocolate cake you'll get from this pound cake recipe with buttermilk and chocolate is dense, dark, and delicious." Ingredients 2-3/4 eggs 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons butter, softened 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons white sugar 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons semisweet chocolate chips 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon hot water 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons buttermilk 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-3/4 cups and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon salt Directions Separate the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff, and set aside. In a large bowl, cream the butter with the sugar. Melt the chocolate in the hot water. Beat in the egg yolks, then the melted chocolate, buttermilk, and vanilla. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Beat into the chocolate mixture. Stir in about 1/3 of the egg whites to lighten the batter and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly. Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until the cake tests done with a toothpick. Let cool on a rack. Makes 16 servings. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
