Recipe By:Carol "This is a fluffy whipped frosting that is lovely on cakes. Makes enough to frost one 9x13 inch cake." Ingredients 2-1/2 cups white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon light corn syrup 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons water 1-3/4 egg whites 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon almond extract 1/2 teaspoon salt Directions Cook sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly until sugar dissolves. Cover then cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer. Uncover and continue cooking to the firm ball stage 244 to 248 degrees F (118 to 120 degrees C). Remove from heat. Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with the vanilla extract, almond extract, and salt until stiff but not dry. Pour hot syrup in a slow, steady stream over beaten egg whites, beating constantly. Continue beating until frosting stands in peaks and begins to lose its gloss, about 10 minutes. If necessary, thin with a few drops of cream.
