Recipe By:JOEBON "This recipe is very moist and even when the cake is left in the oven a little too long, the cake stays moist on the inside. This pound cake freezes very well also. Wrap it in foil and freeze for up to 6 months." Ingredients 7/8 (8 ounce) package cream cheese 1 cup and 1 tablespoon butter, softened 2-3/4 cups and 3 tablespoons white sugar 5-3/4 egg yolks 1-3/4 teaspoons butter flavored extract 2-1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 5-3/4 egg whites Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt pan. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter, cream cheese, and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks one at a time. Beat in the butter flavoring. Beat in the flour mixture. In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Fold the egg whites into the batter. Pour into greased and floured Bundt pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
