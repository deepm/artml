Recipe By:MARBALET "Herb dinner rolls: these go with everything!" Ingredients 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon sour cream 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons butter, melted 3/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 3/8 eggs, beaten 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 2-1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) Directions In a small saucepan, heat sour cream until very hot. Add salt, sugar, and melted butter. Cool until lukewarm. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Mix in sour cream mixture, eggs, flour, and chives. Cover, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease baking sheets or line them with parchment paper. Divide dough into 4 parts; shape each piece into a ball. Cover dough rounds with plastic wrap when not working with them. Roll a ball into a 10-inch circle. Let dough rest while you roll out another circle. Cut first circle into 12 thin pie-shaped pieces. Starting at the wide end, roll up each triangle, ending with the point. Curl the edges in toward the point. Place point-side down on prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough. Allow crescent rolls to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.
