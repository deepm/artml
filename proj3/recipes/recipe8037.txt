Recipe By:Bernadette Beaupre "This cake comes in handy when all you have left in the cupboard is the tin soups just before shopping day. It really was a treat served warm when we came in from the cold. And it was c-o-l-l-l-d-d-d, North of 53'. Sprinkle brown sugar or dust confectioner's sugar over the top." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons shortening 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon salt 7/8 (10.75 ounce) can condensed tomato soup 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon raisins 1-1/4 cups boiling water 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8 inch square pan. In a large bowl, combine sugar, shortening, spices, salt, soup, and raisins. Stir in boiling water. Cool. Sift the flour, baking powder, and baking soda together. Add to the cooled raisin mixture, and stir until just combined. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Serve warm.
