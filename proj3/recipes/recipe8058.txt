Recipe By:Dawn Vassel "A friend made this for our group and we have been hooked on it ever since. Try it. It's so rich, moist, and easy, you'll be hooked too! Note: I have replaced the sour cream with 16 ounces of plain yogurt, (not fat-free!), with great success. The taste is just as good to me with a lot less fat. However, do not use low-fat or fat-free sour cream, as it will NOT turn out well!" Ingredients 7/8 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix 3-1/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 13 ounces sour cream 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon coffee flavored liqueur 7 ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips Directions Grease one 10 inch bundt cake pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together cake mix, eggs, oil, sour cream, coffee liqueur, and chocolate chips, in the order listed, and pour into the greased bundt cake pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for one hour or until the surface springs back when touched lightly. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
