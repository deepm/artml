Recipe By:Carol "My daughter made these when she was in Brownies. These were quite a hit with the girls. You can use a lemon icing, green buttercream icing, or a peanut butter icing--or a combination of all." Ingredients 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 7/8 eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2/3 cup and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon milk 10 flat bottomed ice cream cones Directions Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cream butter and sugar together well in mixing bowl. Beat in eggs 1 at a time. Mix in vanilla. Measure flour, baking powder and salt into small bowl. Stir. Add milk to butter mixture in 2 parts alternately with flour mixture in 3 parts, beginning and ending with flour. Fill cones about 3/4 full leaving the batter 1/2 inch from top. Place filled cones on a baking tray. Bake in oven for about 15 to 20 minutes until an inserted toothpick comes out clean.
