Ingredients 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons white sugar 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 cup and 2 tablespoons water 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1-3/4 eggs 2-1/2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, melted 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon butter 3-3/4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon milk 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 7/8 (16.5 ounce) can pitted dark sweet cherries, drained with juice reserved 2-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons orange liqueur Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2- 8 or 9 inch round cake pans. In a medium sized bowl combine flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add water, shortening, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until combined. Then beat on high speed for 2 minutes. Add eggs and melted chocolate and beat 2 minutes more. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. Cool cakes on a wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove cakes from pans and let cool thoroughly on a wire rack. To Make Frosting: Beat butter until fluffy. Gradually add 2 cups of confectioner's sugar and the cocoa. Beat well than add the milk, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat in the remaining confectioner's sugar and any additional milk as needed for spreadability. To Make Filling: Drain cherries reserving 2/3 cup of the liquid. In a medium sauce pan combine reserved liquid and cornstarch, add fruit. Cook over medium heat and stir until thickened and bubbly. Cook and stir for more 2 minutes and then stir in the orange or cherry liqueur. Remove from heat cover and cool without stirring. Arrange one cake layer on a serving dish and spread the cooled cherry filling over the top (reserve some cherries for a garnish for top of cake). Place second layer on top filling and frost sides and top of cake with frosting. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
