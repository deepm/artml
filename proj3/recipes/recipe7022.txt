Recipe By:Michelle Chen "This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. It goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, such as the Butter Chicken." Ingredients 1 cup and 2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1-3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1-3/4 teaspoons white sugar 3-1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1-3/4 teaspoons salt 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon ghee 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon plain yogurt 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon kalonji (onion seed) Directions Whisk the warm water with the yeast and sugar until the yeast is dissolved. Cover and let stand in a warm place for 10 minutes. Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture, half of the ghee and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size . Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll each piece out into 8 inch round naans. Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a little of the remaining ghee and sprinkle with some of the kalonji. Cook naan one at a time under the broiler for about 2 minutes on each side or until puffed and just browned.
