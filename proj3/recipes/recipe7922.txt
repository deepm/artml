Recipe By:Carol "This cake has a lot of raisins soaked in rum. Try to soak your raisins overnight if possible or at least for a few hours." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon golden raisins 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon raisins 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon dark rum 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1-3/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon whole wheat flour 2-1/2 teaspoons cornstarch 1-3/4 teaspoons baking soda 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon salt 2-1/2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts 1-1/4 cups applesauce Directions Place all the raisins in a small bowl with the rum and let sit overnight or at least 4 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking pan. In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time; mix in applesauce. In another bowl, stir together the flours, cornstarch, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and cocoa. Gradually add flour into the batter, mixing until fully incorporated. Stir in the raisins, along with any rum that was not absorbed, and the walnuts. Turn batter into the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Cool on wire rack.
