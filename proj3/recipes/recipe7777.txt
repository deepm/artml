Recipe By:Gary "This recipe is at least 90 years old, my grandmother says they used it a lot during the depression. Also, you can substitute lemon, almond, or whatever for the vanilla if you're so inclined, but I like vanilla the best. It's also fat free." Ingredients 1-1/4 egg whites 2/3 cup corn syrup 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions In a bowl combine the egg whites, corn syrup, and vanilla beat on high speed of an electric mixer for about 6 to 7 minutes. The longer you beat it the stiffer it gets. So if you like a stiff frosting continue beating a little longer.
