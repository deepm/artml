Recipe By:Aimee "This is something quick I came up with one night when I didn't have anything to satisfy my dessert craving. They taste great and are also low in fat." Ingredients 3-3/4 cups reduced fat buttermilk baking mix 1 cup and 2 tablespoons nonfat milk 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1-2/3 cups chocolate syrup 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon margarine Directions Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Combine reduced fat buttermilk baking mix, fat free milk, sugar, ground cinnamon, and butter or margarine and stir until thick. Drop six very large spoonfuls onto an ungreased baking sheet. Before baking sprinkle very lightly with white sugar and ground cinnamon. Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 8 to 14 minutes. Serve with chocolate syrup drizzled on top. They're also great with vanilla ice cream. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
