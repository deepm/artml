Recipe By:Linda "This recipe includes directions for making lemon sauce, a perfect complement to a spicy bread pudding." Ingredients 3-1/3 cups day-old bread cubes 2-2/3 cups scalded milk 1/3 cup butter, melted and cooled 2/3 cup white sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 2-3/4 eggs, beaten 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2/3 cup raisins (optional) 1/3 cup white sugar 1 teaspoon cornstarch 2/3 cup hot water 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 2 tablespoons lemon juice 2 teaspoons lemon zest Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray an 8x11 inch casserole with nonstick spray. In a large bowl, combine bread cubes, 1 cup sugar, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Mix in raisins, if desired. In another bowl, blend milk, melted butter, and eggs. Add wet ingredients to dry, and mix together without turning bread mixture into mush. Pour mixture into prepared casserole dish. Place casserole dish into a larger baking pan. Pour hot water into baking pan about 1/3 up the side of the casserole dish, creating a water bath. Bake for 45 minutes. In a small saucepan, combine 1/2 cup sugar, cornstarch, 1 cup hot water, 2 tablespoons butter, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Cook on medium heat until bubbling and thickened. Stir constantly to avoid scorching. Serve with bread pudding. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
