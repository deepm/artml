Recipe By:Candace "Over the years I have revised this recipe until I found just the right mix. It is incredibly moist and flavorful. It may take longer to cook so be patient." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 2-1/2 very ripe bananas, mashed 1-3/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray two 9x5 inch loaf pans with non-stick cooking spray. Cream the shortening and sugar until light. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. Add to the shortening mixture and mix to combine. Thoroughly mash the bananas. Stir bananas into the batter then stir in the walnuts. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes to 1 hour or until a wooden skewer inserted near the center comes out clean. Check with a wooden skewer every 15 minutes after 45 minutes of baking. It can take up to 65 to 70 minutes to cook.
