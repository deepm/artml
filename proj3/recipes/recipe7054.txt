Recipe By:Kevin Ryan "This bread takes pumpkin bread to a whole new realm. I invented this one day when thinking of how to make pumpkin bread retain its moistness even longer. Solution: coconut milk!" Ingredients 1-3/4 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup packed dark brown sugar 1/3 cup white sugar 1/2 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree 1/2 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup coconut milk 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup unsweetened flaked coconut 2/3 cup and 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts, toasted Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 x 4 inch loaf pans. Combine flour, sugars, pumpkin, oil, coconut milk, baking soda, salt, and spices. Mix until well blended. Fold in coconut and nuts. Pour into prepared pans. Bake for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Remove from oven. Cover with foil tightly, and allow to steam 10 minutes. Remove foil, and turn out onto cooling rack. Tent lightly with the foil, and allow to cool completely. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
