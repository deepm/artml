Recipe By:Neeky "Tuppakaka is a Swedish cake. It is very easy to do, but turns out a wonderful cake. Gooey in the middle, and almost like meringue on top." Ingredients 2-1/2 eggs 1-1/2 cups and 1 tablespoon white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 1-1/4 cups + 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons sliced almonds Directions Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9 inch springform pan, and sprinkle with dry breadcrumbs. Stir together the egg and sugar. Melt butter or margarine, and stir into mix. Add flour; mix until smooth, but not fluffy. Spread the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle flaked almonds on top. Bake for 25 minutes. Allow cake to cool slightly before removing from the pan. Cool completely on a wire rack. This cake keeps very well for up to a week in an airtight container or plastic bag.
