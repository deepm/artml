Recipe By:Holly "Yum! What can be better than a hot sticky bun for breakfast-or a late night snack? Pop one (leftover) into the microwave for a few seconds to make them taste fresh from the oven." Ingredients 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/2 cup and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 7/8 eggs 2-1/4 cups and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon margarine, softened 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 2-1/2 teaspoons margarine, softened 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon melted butter 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon raisins 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon chopped pecans Directions Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Add buttermilk, eggs, 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup white sugar, baking powder and salt. Blend 30 seconds with mixer on low speed, scraping sides and bottom of bowl. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed. Stir in remaining 3 cups flour. Dough should remain soft and slightly sticky. Knead for 5 minutes, or about 200 turns on a lightly floured board. Form dough into a round and place it in an oiled bowl. Cover it with a damp cloth and leave it in a warm place to rise until doubled. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a 12x7 inch rectangle. Spread each half with 1 tablespoon soft margarine, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. Roll up halves, beginning at wide side. Seal well by pinching the seams. Cut each roll into 12 slices. Coat two 9 inch round cake pans with 1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans in each pan. Place 12 dough slices in each pan, leaving a small space between slices. Let rise until doubled. Bake in a preheated 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) oven for about 30 minutes. Invert pans onto serving plate.
