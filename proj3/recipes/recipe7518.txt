Recipe By:Nancy Reeves "I make this one cake every Christmas. It stays moist and delicious throughout the Holidays." Ingredients 1 cup and 1 tablespoon butter 2-3/4 cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 11 ounces chopped pecans 11 ounces candied cherries 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons white sugar 4-1/4 eggs 11 ounces candied pineapple 1 cup and 1 tablespoon golden raisins 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 Golden Delicious apple - peeled, cored and sliced Directions Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease one 10 inch tube pan. Line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper and dust pan with flour. Cream the light butter together with the white sugar. Add eggs one at a time mixing well after each one. Mix in the vanilla extract. Stir in 3 cups of the flour, baking powder, and salt and blend well. Toss candied cherries, chopped pecans, candied pineapple, and white raisins with the remaining 1 cup flour. Stir fruit and nut mixture into the batter and pour into prepared pan. Bake at 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) for 3 hours. Let cake cool for 20 minutes before removing from pan. After cake is cold, cut a piece of waxed paper to fit the top of the cake. Put the apple slices on top of the waxed paper and put cake into a closed container. Store cake in a cool dry area for about 3 days or until the cake takes up the juice from the apple slices. Remove apple slice and waxed paper and serve. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
