Recipe By:Cathy "This is the only cheesecake that I have found that has the shortdough crust and it is a good tasting cake. It takes time to make, but is well worth the time." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sifted all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 teaspoon lemon zest 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 7/8 egg yolk, beaten 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 pound cream cheese 1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1-3/4 eggs 7/8 egg yolk 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream Directions Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). To Make Dough Crust: Combine 1 cup of the flour, 1/4 cup of the sugar and 1 teaspoon grated lemon peel. Cut in the butter or margarine until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the beaten egg yolk and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Pat 1/3 of the dough into the bottom of one 9 inch springform pan with the sides removed. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 6 minutes. Let cool then butter sides of pan and attach to bottom. Pat the remaining dough evenly on the sides to a height of 2 inches. To Make Filling: Preheat oven to 500 degrees F (260 degree C). Stir cream cheese to soften, then beat until fluffy add 1/8 teaspoon vanilla and 1/2 teaspoon grated lemon peel. Mix 1 1/2 tablespoons flour, 1/8 teaspoon salt and the remaining sugar together. Gradually blend this mixture into the cream cheese mixture. Add the eggs and the egg yolk one at a time, beating well after each one. Gently stir in the heavy cream. Pour batter into the prepared crust. Bake at 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) for 5 to 8 minutes or until top edge of crust is golden. Reduce heat to 200 degrees F (100 degrees C) and continue baking for 1 hour. Remove cake from oven and cool in pan for at least 3 hours. Remove sides of pan to serve.
