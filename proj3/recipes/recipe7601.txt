Recipe By:Brenda Benzar Butler "This is a good frosting for Mayonnaise Cake. If you're really having a chocolate fit, double the glaze! The frosting and cake are rich enough to cut the unsweetened chocolate taste. Pour some glaze on the middle layer too." Ingredients 3-1/3 cups confectioners' sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon mint extract 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon milk 1-3/4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons butter Directions In a large bowl, cream 1 1/3 cups sugar with 1/2 cup butter or margarine, and salt. Blend extract, 2 tablespoons milk, and remaining sugar into mixture. Gradually stir remaining milk into frosting until desired spreading consistency is reached. Melt and stir unsweetened chocolate and 2 tablespoons butter or margarine together in a microwave, or in a double boiler. Double this glaze if desired. Frost cake. Pipe a frosting scallop at the top edge of the cake to keep glaze from dripping down the sides of the cake. Pour the glaze over the top of the cake. Chill until glaze has set.
