Recipe By:Kevin Ryan "The honey topping was called 'bienstich' by the German bakers who invented it, probably because of its sweetness." Ingredients 7/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons warm water 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 7/8 eggs, room temperature 1-1/4 egg yolks 1/4 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon warm milk 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon sour cream, room temperature 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 2-1/2 teaspoons unsalted butter, melted 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons unsalted butter 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons honey 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons lemon juice 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon sliced almonds 2 cups pastry cream Directions Combine the yeast, and the warm water; set aside to proof for 5 minutes. Cream 3/4 cup butter and sugar until light. Beat in the eggs and yolks one at a time. Add the vanilla, milk, sour cream, and yeast. Beat until smooth. Add the flour a little at a time to form a soft dough. Add all of the flour, and continue to beat until elastic, about 8 minutes. Place dough into an oiled bowl, cover and place in a warm spot until doubled in size, about 50 minutes. Can be placed in the refrigerator overnight instead. Beat down the dough, and divide into two pieces. Place each in a buttered 9 inch square pan. Brush the top of each with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Cover and let rise until doubled. For the glaze, place the brown sugar, 6 tablespoons butter, cream, and honey in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and stir until the sugar dissolves. Boil for 30 seconds. Remove from heat; add the lemon juice and almonds. Let cool slightly. Drizzle the warm glaze, not hot, over each of the cakes. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes, or until the nuts are golden. Cool on a rack. Split the cakes lengthwise using a serrated knife, and fill with the pastry cream. Sandwich cakes back together and serve. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
