Recipe By:Carol "This is a lovely show off cake, especially when you want a fancy finale to a dinner party. Sprinkle with confectioners sugar over top just before serving to make it look even more attractive and delectable." Ingredients 4-1/4 eggs 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons butter, softened 1 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 1/2 cup and 2 teaspoons seedless raspberry jam 2-1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 tablespoons and 2-1/2 teaspoons dark rum 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 cup and 2 teaspoons ground walnuts 1/2 cup and 2 teaspoons ground pecans Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 inch tube pan. Separate the eggs. In a bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat the butter with the sugar until thoroughly creamed. Beat in the egg yolks, then the jam, vanilla extract, and dark rum. In a small bowl, stir together the flour and baking powder. Beat the flour mixture into the creamed mixture, then stir in the nuts. Stir about 1/3 of the beaten egg whites into the batter to lighten it and then fold in the rest gently but thoroughly. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 65 to 70 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Transfer to a rack to cool. Makes about 12 servings.
