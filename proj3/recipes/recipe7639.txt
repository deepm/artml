Recipe By:Carol "This is a frosting I normally put on birthday cakes. Its like the frosting that bakeries put on cakes, but I much prefer to make my own since I know what I am putting into it, and as always, homemade is best." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons butter, softened 1/8 teaspoon salt 5 cups confectioners' sugar 2-1/2 egg yolk, beaten 1-1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons milk Directions Cream butter until soft. Add salt and part of sugar gradually, blending after each addition. Then add egg yolks and vanilla; blend well. Add remaining sugar, alternately with milk, until of right consistency to spread, beating after each addition until smooth. Makes 2 1/2 cups or enough frosting to cover tops and sides of two 8 or 9 inch layers. Note: If desired, 1 whole egg may be substituted for the 2 egg yolks to make 2 3/4 cups frosting.
