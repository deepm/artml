Recipe By:Brent "My grandmother used to serve this with cheese as a pre-dinner snack while we waited for the turkey. She used a heavy cast iron griddle, lightly floured. I use a 1 1/2 inch wood dowel to roll out nice and thin." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon light corn syrup 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom 2-3/4 cups and 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour Directions In a large bowl, mix by hand sour milk or buttermilk, corn syrup, sugar, soda, cardamom, and flour until mixture becomes a soft pliable dough. Divide the dough into 12 or so pieces. Roll out each piece until about 1/8 inch thick. Bake on a lightly floured griddle over very low heat for 12 to 15 minutes per side. Serve warm with your favorite cheese or jam.
