Ingredients 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons white sugar 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons butter 3-1/2 eggs 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon milk 2-1/2 ounces flaked coconut 3/4 teaspoon coconut extract 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons white sugar 2 tablespoons and 2-1/2 teaspoons water 3/4 teaspoon coconut extract 1/2 cup and 1 teaspoon chopped walnuts Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a large bowl, cream together 2 cups sugar and the butter. Fold in the eggs one at a time, fully incorporating each one before adding another. In separate bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, milk, flaked coconut, and 1 teaspoon coconut extract. Beat into the creamed mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack for just a few minutes, then place on cake platter.
