Recipe By:MARBALET "Nothing smells better than home-baked bread--this is a hearty bread, great with mustard, corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut." Ingredients 7/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons lukewarm milk 2-1/2 teaspoons white sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon molasses 2-1/2 teaspoons butter 1-1/3 cups rye flour 1 cup and 1 tablespoon bread flour Directions Dissolve yeast in warm water. In a large bowl combine milk, sugar, and salt. Use a mixer to beat in molasses, butter, yeast mixture, and 1 cup of rye flour. Use a wooden spoon to mix in the remaining rye flour. Add white flour by stirring until the dough is stiff enough to knead. Knead 5 to 10 minutes, adding flour as needed. If the dough sticks to your hands or the board add more flour. Cover dough and let rise 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until double. Punch down dough and divide to form two round loaves. Let loaves rise on a greased baking sheet until double, about 1 1/2 hours. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
