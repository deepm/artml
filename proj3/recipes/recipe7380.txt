Recipe By:Rebecca "A fruity spice cake that has been in our family for years. The frosting is really tasty." Ingredients 7/8 large orange 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon raisins 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon walnuts 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 7/8 egg 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 2-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons orange zest Directions Squeeze the juice from the orange, and then remove the white from the peel. Place the peel, nuts and raisins in a food processor, and grind coarsely. Add the orange juice to the nut mixture. Cream the shortening and sugar together until light and fluffy. Beat the egg, and add it to the creamed mixture. Sift together the flour, soda, baking powder, and spices. Add the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk to the creamed mixture. Stir in 3/4 of the nut mixture, and reserve the rest for the icing. Pour batter into a greased and floured 10 inch square pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 hour. Cool. To Make Frosting: Blend the cream and vanilla with the confectioners' sugar in a small mixing bowl. Add the remaining nut mixture and the grated orange rind. Frost the cooled cake with this icing.
