Recipe By:Jackie Cooper "I've always called this a buckle (I'm from the Midwest), but my friends here in California, say it's a 'coffee cake', but no matter the name they love it!" Ingredients 1/3 cup butter, softened 1/3 cup white sugar 5/8 egg 1-1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1-3/4 teaspoons baking powder 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt 1-1/3 cups fresh strawberries 1-1/3 cups fresh raspberries 1/3 cup white sugar 1/3 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup butter Directions Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 11x7 inch glass baking dish. Cream 1/2 cup of the butter or margarine with 1/2 cup of the white sugar until light, beat in the egg. Add the baking powder and the salt. Stir in the 2 cups of flour one cup at a time alternating with the yogurt. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Arrange fruit over top of batter. Sprinkle topping over fruit. To Make Topping: Mix together 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup butter or margarine, and the cinnamon until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 1 hour and 15 minutes or until the cake is top is puffed and nicely browned. Allow cake to cool. You can serve it directly from the baking dish or for a more attractive presentation, I cut it up into squares and arrange them on a platter.
