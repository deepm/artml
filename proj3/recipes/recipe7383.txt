Recipe By:Rhema Hernandez "This is a great warm weather dish, since it needs no baking, just overnight refrigeration. My sister gave me this recipe years and years ago. You can buy a pre-made pound cake or make one." Ingredients 1/2 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk 1 (12 fluid ounce) cans evaporated milk 1/2 (16 ounce) can fruit cocktail 1 eggs 1/2 (12 ounce) package pound cake 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract Directions Drain fruit cocktail, and set fruit aside. Combine juice from fruit cocktail, milks, and eggs in a small saucepan. Cook and stir over medium low heat until thick, but not separated. Add lemon flavoring. Dice pound cake. Layer cake, custard, and fruit in a 9 x 12 casserole dish or a trifle dish. Refrigerate overnight. Serve cold.
