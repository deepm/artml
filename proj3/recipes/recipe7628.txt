Recipe By:Carol "This recipe is for those of you who wish to make your own almond paste. I prefer making my own. When I feel lazy, I purchase it in specialty stores. Rose water can be substituted for the almond extract, and can be purchased in Middle Eastern stores, or maybe even health food stores." Ingredients 13 ounces blanched almonds 7/8 (16 ounce) package confectioners' sugar 2-1/2 egg whites 3/4 teaspoon almond extract Directions Grind almonds in a blender. Thoroughly mix in confectioners sugar. Beat egg whites slightly, then stir into the almond mixture. Add almond extract or rosewater (see Cook's Note), using your hands to blend the heavy mixture. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 3 months.
