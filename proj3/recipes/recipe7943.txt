Recipe By:DAVEK312 "This is a great chocolate cake that my family loves especially with it's whipped cream frosting!" Ingredients 1 cup and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 eggs 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon cold, brewed coffee 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon milk 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon butter 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon shortening 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Combine and sift together 2 cups flour, 2 cups sugar, cocoa, salt, baking soda and baking powder. In a small bowl, blend together eggs, oil, 1 cup milk and 1 teaspoon vanilla; combine with dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly and then stir in one cup cold coffee (may use instant coffee). Batter will be very thin but it bakes into a rich, dark, moist cake. Pour into a greased 9 x 13 inch pan. Bake for about 40 minutes. To Make Whipped Cream Frosting: Combine 1/4 cup flour and 1 cup milk, adding milk slowly and beating until smooth. Set over moderate heat and stir constantly until thickened. Set aside to chill completely. Combine 1 1/2 cups confectioners sugar with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening beating until light and fluffy; stir in well cooled flour-milk mixture and beat at high speed until thick and creamy. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and beat until thoroughly combined. Spread frosting over cooled cake. Enjoy!
