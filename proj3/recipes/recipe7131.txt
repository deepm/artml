Recipe By:Charlene "This bread contains no wheat, eggs, cow's milk, or yeast. I find all of these ingredients in our large health food store and food co-op." Ingredients 1-1/4 cups soy milk 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon honey 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons liquid lecithin 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon oat flour 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons brown rice flour 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon soy flour 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 2-1/2 teaspoons arrowroot powder 3/4 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon rolled oats Directions Sift together oat flour, rice flour, soy flour, baking powder, arrowroot powder, sea salt, and cinnamon. Stir in rolled oats. In a large bowl, mix together soy milk, honey, oil, and lecithin. Stir in the flour mixture, and mix well. The batter will be stiff. Scoop batter into a lightly oiled 9 x 5 inch loaf pan, and smooth into place. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 75 minutes, or until the loaf is firm and lightly browned. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out clean. If loaf gets too dark before it is done, tent with aluminum foil for the remainder of the baking time. Cool completely before removing from pan and slicing.
