Recipe By:Judalee "A beautiful cake for the strawberry lover. Easy to make with packaged gelatin and white cake mix. Fresh strawberries can be used when they are in season." Ingredients 7/8 (3 ounce) package strawberry flavored Jell-O(R) 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon cold water 7/8 (18.25 ounce) package white cake mix 3-1/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 7/8 (10 ounce) package frozen strawberries, thawed 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon butter 1-2/3 cups confectioners' sugar Directions Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, dissolve the gelatin in cold water; stir in the cake mix, eggs, vegetable oil, flour and 1/2 of the strawberries. Beat for 5 minutes on the medium speed of an electric mixer. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the layers spring back when lightly pressed in the center. Cool cakes in the pans on wire racks. To Make Frosting: Cream the butter, sugar and the remaining half of the strawberries in a medium bowl until light and fluffy, adding additional confectioners' sugar if needed for a spreadable consistency. Spread the frosting between layers and over the top and sides of cake. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
