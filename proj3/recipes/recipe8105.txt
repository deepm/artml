Recipe By:E. Cole "This is my husband's favorite recipe for cheesecake. The flour adds a texture that makes it unique. You can use a pastry crust instead of graham, if you prefer." Ingredients 1-3/4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 7/8 egg 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk 7/8 (9 inch) graham cracker crust Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix together cream cheese, sugar, and egg by hand. Gradually mix in flour. Stir in vanilla. Blend in milk until smooth; add more liquid if batter is too thick to pour. Pour into graham or pastry shell. Bake for 40 minutes, or until top is golden brown. Refrigerate overnight.
