Add 1/2 cup of the sugar gradually, and continue beating only until meringue will hold up in soft peaks. Cream shortening. Add remaining 1-1/4 cups sugar gradually, and cream together until light and fluffy. Add flour alternately with milk, a small amount at a time; beat after each addition until smooth. Stir in vanilla.
