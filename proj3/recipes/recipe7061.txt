Recipe By:Kevin Ryan "A trip to the health food store will be necessary for these flapjacks, but it is worth it. While there, pick up some real maple syrup to serve with them!" Ingredients 3-1/4 egg 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon apple juice 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter, melted 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon amaranth flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon tapioca flour 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons arrowroot flour 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3-1/4 pinches ground nutmeg 1-3/4 teaspoons wheat-free baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt Directions In a medium mixing bowl, beat the egg with the apple juice and melted butter. Add the remaining ingredients and stir. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. This batter must be used right away and can not sit and wait. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
