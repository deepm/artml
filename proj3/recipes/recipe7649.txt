Recipe By:Sally E. Forsythe "This cake is delicious, my grandmother gave me this recipe two years ago. She brought it to my house to give to my family when my baby sister was born. I remember that I had six pieces of it while my mother and grandmother were talking! It was gone by the next day, and guess who ate the last few pieces... that is right , yours truly! It is a lot like a sweet brownie." Ingredients 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon honey 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon strong brewed coffee, room temperature 7/8 egg Directions Heat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan. In one medium bowl, stir together four, baking powder, baking soda, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Next, stir in sugar, honey, oil, and coffee. With an electric beater at medium speed, beat batter for two minutes; add egg, and beat for one minute longer. Pour into prepared pan.
