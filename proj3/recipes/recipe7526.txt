Recipe By:Sandy in Baltimore "This honey cake is a great dessert for dinners surrounding the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah, but also just for a tasty honey cake any time you want one." Ingredients Cake: 2 cups and 3 tablespoons sifted all-purpose flour 1/8 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1-1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground allspice 2-1/2 eggs 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1-1/4 cups honey 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon blanched slivered almonds 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon raisins 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon slivered almonds for topping Glaze (Optional): 3/4 cup and 3 tablespoons honey 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon lemon juice 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon water 1/4 teaspoon lemon zest Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Oil two loaf pans and line bottoms with parchment paper; grease the parchment as well. Sift together the flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and allspice. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, gradually adding the sugar. Beat until thick and light in color, about 5 minutes. Beat in the oil, honey and coffee. Stir flour mixture into egg mixture. Chop the almonds coarsely and mix with raisins; stir into batter. Divide batter between the two prepared loaf pans. Sprinkle with reserved slivered almonds. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center of each cake comes out clean, 65 to 75 minutes. Let cool 10 minutes and remove from pan. To Make Glaze: combine 1 1/2 cups honey, lemon juice, lemon zest and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. When glaze reaches a thick consistency, remove from heat and drizzle over warm cake. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
