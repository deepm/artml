Recipe By:Justlynne "A moist bread with different spices than standard zucchini bread recipes. This is the best one I've tried, thanks to my stepmom-in-law. I like to freeze the shredded zucchini, and make this in the fall and winter. It's wonderful to serve at the Thanksgiving table." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1-1/4 eggs 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon grated zucchini 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/8 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts (optional) 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon raisins Directions In a large bowl combine sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla. Add grated zucchini. In a separate bowl sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, ground ginger, and ground cloves. Blend dry ingredients into zucchini mixture. Pour into two 8x5 loaf pans coated with cooking spray. Bake in a 325 degree F (165 degrees C) oven for one hour. Cool for 10 minutes and remove from pans. Cool on a wire rack.
