Grease one 9 or 10 inch tube pan. Mix together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar. Mix in the eggs, one at time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the lemon and the vanilla extracts. Gently mix in flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 90 minutes.
