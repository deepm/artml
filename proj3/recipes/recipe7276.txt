Recipe By:v monte "The difference between this and other carrot cakes is the fact that the carrots are pre-cooked instead of raw. It is a really moist cake that is better the day after it is made. Cake tastes best after refrigerating overnight." Ingredients 3-1/4 carrots, quartered 1 cup and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 1 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1-3/4 eggs 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 1/2 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple with juice 1/2 (3.5 ounce) package flaked coconut 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon chopped walnuts 1/4 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon butter 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup and 2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar Directions In a small saucepan, cover carrots with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Let cool and mash. In a large mixing bowl, beat eggs. Add vegetable oil, buttermilk, 2 cups white sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla. Add flour, baking soda, ground cinnamon and salt. Mix in pineapple, 2 cups mashed carrots, nuts and coconut. Pour into paper towel-lined 13 x 9 x 2-1/2 inch pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 minutes, or until cake tests done. Place cake on a plate, and allow to cool completely before frosting.
