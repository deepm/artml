Recipe By:KT Welch "This bread goes great with any Italian meal, or anytime by itself. It's denser and heartier than most yeast breads, and has a thick crust. It has all the flavors of an authentic hand-made loaf, but it comes from the bread machine!" Ingredients 1 cup and 1 tablespoon tomato paste 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sherry 3/4 teaspoon salt 2-1/2 cups bread flour 2-1/2 teaspoons vegetable oil 2-1/2 teaspoons dried basil 1-3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon diced sun-dried tomatoes Directions Place all ingredients in the bread machine in order suggested by your manufacturer (except for the sun dried tomatoes). Select regular setting, medium crust. At the beep or according to your manufacturer's suggestion add the sun dried tomatoes. Remove immediately at end of baking cycle. Let cool and slice, spread with your favorite topping.
