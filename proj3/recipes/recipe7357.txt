Recipe By:Diane "This is our family's New Year's cake. A coin is baked in the cake, and the person who finds the coin in their slice is has good luck for the year; they also get a prize." Ingredients 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons butter, softened 1-1/4 cups and 1 tablespoon white sugar 3-1/2 eggs 1 tablespoon and 1-1/4 teaspoons water 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 2 cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon blanched slivered almonds 1 tablespoon and 1-1/4 teaspoons sesame seeds Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a large bowl, blend together the butter or margarine and the sugar. Separate 3 of the eggs; add the yolks and the 2 remaining whole eggs to the butter mixture. Stir in the vanilla and water. In another bowl, sift together the baking powder and flour. Add these dry ingredients to the creamed mixture. Whip 3 egg whites until they are foamy. Add 1 tablespoon sugar. Continue to whip the whites until they are stiff, but not dry. Fold whipped whites into batter. Pour the batter into a greased 10 x 4 inch tube pan. Wrap a large coin in foil, and place the coin in the batter. Press the coin down; it should be completely hidden. Sprinkle the nuts and seeds on top of the batter. Bake the cake for about 70 minutes, or until done. Cool on a wire rack.
