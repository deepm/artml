Recipe By:Jill M. "This bread is a little sweeter and richer than the usual raisin bread. For best results, soak the raisins in rum overnight and measure the raisins after soaking." Ingredients 2 tablespoons rum 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup water 2 cups bread flour 1 tablespoon dry milk powder 2 teaspoons brown sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons butter 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream 1/2 teaspoon rum flavored extract 1 egg 1 teaspoon olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast Directions In a small bowl, pour rum over raisins. Let stand for 30 minutes and drain. Place ingredients in pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Use the regular setting for a 1 pound loaf. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the raisins at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
