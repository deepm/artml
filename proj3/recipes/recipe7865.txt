Recipe By:Carol "This cake recipe makes lemony, light, and luscious lemon-flavored chiffon cake with a creamy filling made with lemon pie filling." Ingredients 1-1/4 cups cake flour 2-1/4 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 4-1/4 egg yolks 1/2 cup and 2 teaspoons water 2-1/4 teaspoons lemon zest 4-1/4 egg whites 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 cup and 2 teaspoons white sugar 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream 1-3/4 cups and 1 tablespoon lemon pie filling 5-3/4 slices lemon Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, salt, and 1/2 cup sugar. Add oil, egg yolks, water and lemon rind. Beat with an electric mixer until smooth. In a small bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until peaks form. Gradually add 3/4 cup sugar, and beat until very stiff and shiny peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain. Turn batter into ungreased 10-inch tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Invert cake and cool completely in pan. When cool, loosen edges and shake pan to remove cake. To Make Filling: Beat cream to stiff peaks. Fold in lemon filling. Chill until stiff. To Assemble Cake: Slice cake horizontally into 3 equal layers. Fill layers with 1/3 cup of filling. Spread remaining filling on top layer. Decorate with lemon slices.
