Recipe By:Liz "This is a wonderful whole wheat cracker-like bread. It is great topped with butter or cheese. Better yet, it is simple, too!" Ingredients 1 cup and 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour 1 cup and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons buttermilk, room temperature Directions In a large bowl combine the whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour, oil, baking soda, and salt. Add enough buttermilk to make a stiff dough. Knead dough for 30 seconds on a well-floured surface. Cover dough to prevent drying. Roll 1/4 cup handfuls of dough into balls and pat into a flat circle. Using a rolling pin, flatten dough into 10 inch circles. Place onto ungreased cookie sheet. Score pieces into pie shapes by running a knife along but not through dough. Repeat process with remaining dough. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Cool on wire rack briefly before breaking along scored lines.
