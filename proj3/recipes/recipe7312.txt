Recipe By:MSSHARON "This is the fruitcake my mother made from the time I was a little girl. It isn't full of the citrus fruits and I've never met anyone who didn't like it. You may substitute wine or fruit juice for the brandy." Ingredients 1/3 cup dried currants 2/3 cup raisins 1 cup boiling water to cover 1/3 cup candied cherries 3/8 (16 ounce) package gum drops, no licorice ones 2/3 cup pitted dates, cut in half 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon walnuts 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves 3/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon brandy 1/3 cup apple jelly 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 1 cup white sugar 2-1/4 eggs 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda Directions Pour boiling water over raisins and currants to cover. Let steep for 5 minutes, then drain. In a very large bowl combine currants, raisins, gum drops, candied cherries, pitted dates, walnuts, spices, brandy and jelly. Stir to blend. Cover and let stand overnight. Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Grease three 8x4 inch loaf pans. Cream the butter and the sugar together until light and creamy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each one. Stir in the vanilla. Sift the flour and baking soda together. Blend in the flour mixture alternately with the fruit mixture. Pour evenly into three loaf pans. Bake at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) for 2-1/4 to 3 hours or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaves comes out clean.
