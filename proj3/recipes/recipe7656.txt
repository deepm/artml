Recipe By:Carol "I have had many carrot cakes in my time, but this one just hit the spot for me. My niece loved this cake so much that she asked for the recipe and made this one for her husband's birthday. She tried others which were good, but none like this one." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon butter, softened 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon packed brown sugar 2-1/4 eggs 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon orange zest 1-3/4 teaspoons lemon zest 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon orange juice 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice 2-1/4 cups grated carrots 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon whole wheat flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon coarsely chopped walnuts 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon raisins Directions Stir together the flours, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. In a large bowl, cream the butter or margarine with the sugars. Beat in the eggs, and then the citrus peels and juices. Stir in the carrots. Beat the flour mixture into the carrot mixture. Stir in the walnuts and raisins. Turn the batter into a greased and floured tube pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees) for about 90 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick.
