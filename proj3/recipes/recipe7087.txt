Recipe By:Angela Martini "After much trial and error, I've come up with this basic scone recipe which rivals the scones at Tea & Sympathy in NYC." Ingredients 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 7/8 pinch salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon margarine 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons milk Directions Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Sift the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda and salt into a bowl. Rub in the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and enough milk to mix to a soft dough. Turn onto a floured surface, knead lightly and roll out to a 3/4-inch thickness. Cut into 2-inch rounds and place on the prepared baking sheet. Brush with milk to glaze. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 minutes then cool on a wire rack. Serve with butter or clotted cream and jam. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
