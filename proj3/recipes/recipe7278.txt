Recipe By:Kristen Pontier "This buttercream is great for icing cakes, and writing on them. It gets hard when refrigerated, so you have to let it come to room temperature before serving. You cannot make flowers with this recipe. I use this recipe every time I make birthday cakes for my family." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 1-2/3 cups confectioners' sugar 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon butter flavored extract 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour Directions Mix heavy cream and flour in a small bowl. Heat the mixure in the microwave for 45 seconds on high. Set aside to cool. In a mixing bowl, combine butter, shortening, confectioner's sugar, vanilla extract and butter extract. Using and electric mixer, beat on low until combined. Then beat on medium speed for 6-8 minutes. Next add the heavy cream mixture, and beat on medium speed for another 10 minutes. ( Mixture will appear soupy at first, but will become fluffy.) ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
