Recipe By:Ruth Uitto "Slightly sweet whole wheat bread. Use stone ground flour if available. This is a very big recipe, you may want to divide it in half." Ingredients 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon shortening 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon hot water 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon packed brown sugar 5/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 2-1/2 teaspoons white sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 1-1/4 cups bread flour 1-1/4 cups whole wheat flour Directions Dissolve brown sugar in 1 cup hot water. Add shortening, and stir to melt. Let cool. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in 4 cups warm water. Add white sugar, salt, and bread flour. Beat well. Stir in shortening mixture. Stir in enough whole wheat flour to make a stiff but not dry dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a large, well oiled bowl. Cover, and allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk. Divide dough into four equal parts. Shape into loaves. Place in greased, 9 x 5 inch pans, turning each loaf over in pan to grease top. Allow to rise until dough doubles in bulk. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Let cool before slicing.
