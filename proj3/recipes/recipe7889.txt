Recipe By:Carol "This fruit cake does not need a ripening period, and is very lovely to look at and eat." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon ground almonds 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon red candied cherries 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon green candied cherries 1/4 (8 ounce) package diced candied citron 1-2/3 cups golden raisins 2 ounces candied pineapple, diced 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon shortening 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 3/4 cup white sugar 2-1/4 egg yolks 1 teaspoon almond extract 3 tablespoons brandy 3 tablespoons milk 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour 2-1/4 egg whites 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar Directions Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place a pan of water in oven. Grease thoroughly and line with heavy brown paper one set of tier pans (one 9 inch, one 7 inch, and one 5 inch). In a large bowl combine ground almonds and fruits. Dredge with one cup flour. In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup flour and shortening. Gradually blend in white sugar. Beat in egg yolks and almond flavoring; beat until very light and fluffy. Mix together brandy and milk; add alternately with 4 1/2 cups flour to creamed mixture. Make 3 dry and 2 liquid additions, combining lightly after each. In another bowl, beat egg whites with cream of tartar to form stiff but moist peaks. Fold into batter. Fold in floured fruit mixture. Bake for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, depending on size of pan. Bake each cake until it tests done with a toothpick. Remove from pans, and lift off paper. Cool. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
