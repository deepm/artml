Recipe By:Sherry "This bread has all the qualities of a quick bread plus great texture and a heavenly crust. The riper the bananas, the better the flavor. Steel-cut oats are the old-fashioned kind that are not pre-cooked, quick-cooking, or instant. You can find them in health food stores or in groceries that carry specialty type items." Ingredients 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon steel cut oats 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon boiling water 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 7/8 egg 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon mashed bananas 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons brown sugar 1-1/4 teaspoons salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon powdered buttermilk 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon quick cooking oats 2 cups and 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour 1-3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons chopped walnuts Directions Soak the steel cut oats in the boiling water. Let cool to room temperature. Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select cycle; press Start. If your machine has a Fruit setting, add the nuts at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished.
