Recipe By:Becky "This may take some practice. You must work quickly." Ingredients 2-1/2 cups white sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons all-purpose flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons butter, softened 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Combine milk, butter, vanilla, and flour; set aside. Melt sugar in a 10 inch skillet. This takes 15 to 20 minutes, be careful not to let sugar scorch! Warm the milk combination and add to melted sugar. Work quickly because the sugar hardens fast. Frost on cooled cake.
