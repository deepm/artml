Recipe By:Pat K. "This cake should be made at least two weeks ahead to allow the flavors to blend. Hint: I cheat and use the date pieces coated with sugar (instead of regular pitted dates), just taking off most of the sugar by rubbing them in my hands." Ingredients 1 cup and 1 tablespoon red and green candied cherries, quartered 2/3 cup and 2 teaspoons candied pineapple, coarsely chopped 1 cup and 1 tablespoon dates, pitted and chopped 2-1/4 teaspoons all-purpose flour 3 cups and 2 tablespoons chopped pecans 1 cup and 1 tablespoon flaked coconut 3/4 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk Directions Preheat oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch tube pan with a removable bottom. Combine cherries, pineapple, and dates; sprinkle with flour, and toss to coat. Add pecans and coconut; mix thoroughly by tossing. Stir in the sweetened condensed milk, mixing well. Spoon into prepared pan, and smooth the top. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Cool the cake in pan on a wire rack. When completely cool, remove from pan. Wrap in foil tightly. Refrigerate. Cut cake when cold. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
