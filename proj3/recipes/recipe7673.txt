Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Drain all water from raisins. In a medium bowl, mix 1 cup flour into gumdrops, cherries, nuts, and drained raisins. In a large bowl, beat butter or margarine, sugar, and eggs. Mix in applesauce. Stir remaining flour, salt, and cinnamon into creamed mixture. Dissolve soda dissolved in hot water.
