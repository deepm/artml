Recipe By:Tanja Miller "This quick bread recipe tastes like pumpkin pie. Tastes best when served the next day." Ingredients 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1-1/4 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-1/4 cups white sugar 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 1-3/4 eggs 3/8 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon water Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin pie spice. Set aside. In a large bowl, beat together sugar, oil, eggs, and pumpkin. Stir in flour mixture alternately with water. Divide batter evenly between the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven for 60 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. For best flavor, store wrapped in plastic wrap at room temperature for a full day before serving. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
