Recipe By:Linda "Bread when eaten warm and topped with butter can't be beat. The sour cream is not necessary, but makes a better texture bread." Ingredients 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup white sugar 1/4 cup margarine 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1 eggs 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon caraway seed 1-1/4 cups raisins 1 cup buttermilk 1 tablespoon and 1-1/2 teaspoons milk (optional) 1 tablespoon and 1-1/2 teaspoons sour cream (optional) Directions Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Use fingers or a pastry cutter to press in butter or margarine, like a pie crust. When mixture looks fine and crumbly, add raisins and caraway seeds. Mix together and then add eggs, buttermilk, and sour cream. If mixture is not moist, add milk. Pour into two greased and lightly floured loaf pans or a frying pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
