Ingredients Crust: 1-1/4 cups finely crushed chocolate wafer cookies 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon melted butter Cake: 1-3/4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, cut into chunks 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sour cream 2-1/2 large eggs 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Cookie Dough: 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon firmly packed brown sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons water 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon semisweet chocolate chips 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour Topping: 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sour cream 1-3/4 teaspoons white sugar 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the chocolate wafer cookie crumbs, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and melted butter together in a bowl. Press firmly into the bottom and 1/2-inch up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Bake crust in the preheated oven until set, about 8 minutes. Beat cream cheese and 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar together in a bowl until creamy. Add 1 cup sour cream, eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract; beat until batter is smooth. Pour batter over crust into springform pan. Beat 1/4 cup butter, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup white sugar together in a bowl. Stir water and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract into brown sugar mixture. Add chocolate chips and flour; stir until cookie dough is well-combined. Drop cookie dough in 2 tablespoon portions evenly over the top of the cheesecake, pushing dough beneath the surface of the batter. Bake in the preheated oven until cheesecake is almost completely set and jiggles slightly in center when shaken, about 40 minutes. Stir 1 cup sour cream, 2 teaspoons white sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla together in a bowl until smooth. Spread sour cream mixture over hot cheesecake. Cool cake to room temperature and refrigerate until cold, at least 4 hours. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
