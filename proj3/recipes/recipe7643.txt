Recipe By:Carol "I have altered my mother's recipe and added my own to this and I find it is better than hers especially since I replace the milk with yogurt. Now I mostly replace milk with yogurt in my other recipes and this gives a better texture. My husband says it tastes similar to pound cake which he loves so much and I don't put icing, although you can if you wish." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1-1/4 cups all-purpose flour 1-3/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon plain yogurt 3/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2-1/2 teaspoons grated lemon zest Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8 or 9 inch layer pans or one 9 or 10 inch kugelhopf pan. Cream butter, add sugar and blend, beat in the eggs. Sift the cream of tartar and baking soda with the flour twice before adding it to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk and vanilla. (Put in a cup of raisins or walnuts if you wish - it is really great). Pour batter into prepared pan(s). Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes in the layer pans or 45 minutes in the kugelhopf pan, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
