Recipe By:Kevin Ryan "This is an old fashioned pudding cake, with cake and pudding layers in the pan. The name is a play on words because the cake is made by basically pouring the ingredients and, also, because it is a cheap cake to to make ( Poor Cake)." Ingredients 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar 1-3/4 teaspoons baking soda 1/3 cup and 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1-3/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar 1-2/3 cups water Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease one 9 inch square baking pan. Whisk together the flour, sugars, baking soda, cocoa and salt. Stir in the vegetable oil, vanilla and vinegar. Pour batter into the prepared pan and pour the water over the top. Draw a fork through the batter to just barely mix. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve warm. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
