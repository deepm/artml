Recipe By:Suzanne Stull "If you like peanut butter you'll love this frosting, great on chocolate cakes but for a real peanut butter experience try it on a peanut butter cake. If you don't have cream, you may substitute milk." Ingredients 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon butter 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 2-1/2 cups confectioners' sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon cream Directions In a large bowl, beat butter and peanut butter until light and fluffy. Slowly beat in 1/2 of the confectioner's sugar. Mix in 1/4 cup of the cream. Beat in the remaining confectioners' sugar. If necessary, add a little more cream or milk until the frosting reaches a good spreading consistency. Makes enough to frost one 2 layer 9 inch cake or one 9x13 inch cake.
