Recipe By:CAROLE10 "I won first place with this cake at the Cuyahoga County Fair (Cleveland, Ohio) in 1993. For a nuttier variation, you can substitute 1 cup of the flour with 1 cup of ground pecans." Ingredients 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon chopped pecans 2-1/2 cups cake flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsalted butter 2-1/2 cups white sugar 5 eggs 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sour cream 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons orange juice 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract Directions Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch Bundt or tube pan. Sprinkle pecans on bottom of pan; set aside. Sift together flour, salt, and baking soda into a medium bowl; set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter and white sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla. Add flour mixture alternately with sour cream. Pour batter over pecans in prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 75 to 90 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Let cool in pan for 20 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. To prepare the glaze: In a small bowl, combine confectioners' sugar, orange juice and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Drizzle over cake while still warm. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
