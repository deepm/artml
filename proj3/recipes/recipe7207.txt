Recipe By:Debby "A tender, old-fashioned Southern biscuit recipe from my mother-in-law. Grab your cast iron skillet, and you are ready to make these tasty biscuits!" Ingredients 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon buttermilk 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons mayonnaise 1-2/3 cups self-rising flour Directions In a large bowl mix together the buttermilk, oil, and mayonnaise. Gradually stir in the flour and mix until all ingredients are combined. Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. If dough is sticky knead in a little extra flour. Pat the dough out to about a 1/2-inch thickness. Use a biscuit cutter to cut dough into pieces. Place into an oiled cast iron skillet. Allow biscuits to rest in the pan for 10 minutes. Bake in a preheated 425 degree F (220 degrees C) until nicely browned, about 20 minutes.
