Recipe By:Wendy "This fudgy frosting will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator." Ingredients 3-3/4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons butter 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons light corn syrup 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons white sugar 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon milk 1-1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract Directions In a saucepan on very low heat, carefully melt the chocolate and butter, stirring constantly. Add the corn syrup, sugar, and milk. Increase heat to medium-high, bring to a boil, and cook for 5-8 minutes, stirring only occasionally, until the mixture becomes a candy-like, gooey fudge. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla. Let chill to spreadable consistency.
