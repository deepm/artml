Recipe By:v monte "This is called a bread, but tastes more like a cake. I make this mostly during the holidays. The spices in this cake just lend themselves to eggnog and Christmas smells. Recipe will make: 4 small loaves, or 2 medium loaves, or 1 large loaf, or 1 bundt cake." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil 2-1/2 eggs 1-3/4 (6 ounce) jars plum baby food 1-2/3 cups white sugar 3/4 teaspoon red food coloring 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 3/4 teaspoon ground cloves 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 cup and 3 tablespoons chopped walnuts 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar 2 tablespoons and 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice Directions In a large bowl, mix together vegetable oil, white sugar, eggs, baby food, and food coloring. In separate bowl, mix together flour, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, baking soda and nuts. Mix wet and dry ingredients together.
