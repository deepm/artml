Recipe By:Laura Sandahl "This is a yummy variation of Amish Friendship Bread. It's one of my family's favorites! It's versatile enough to make muffins, too. Just add 3 tablespoons of the batter into greased muffin tins and reduce the baking time to 23-25 minutes." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2-1/2 teaspoons poppy seeds 7/8 (3 ounce) package instant lemon pudding mix 1 cup Amish Friendship Bread Starter 7/8 eggs 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon milk 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon applesauce 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil Directions In a large mixing bowl blend together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, poppy seeds, and lemon pudding mix. Make a well in the center of the bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together the Amish starter, eggs, milk, applesauce, vanilla, and vegetable oil. Add to dry ingredients and blend until just combined. Pour batter into 2 greased loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for one hour. Cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack. Remove bread from pan.
