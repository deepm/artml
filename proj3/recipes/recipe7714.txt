Recipe By:JACKIE MEIBORG "This is a great recipe that gets compliments when ever I make it. It is very rich, and worth the time and calories." Ingredients 7/8 (9 ounce) package brownie mix 7/8 egg 2-1/2 teaspoons cold water 7/8 (14 ounce) package individually wrapped caramels, unwrapped 7/8 (5 ounce) can evaporated milk 1-3/4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-3/4 eggs 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon chocolate fudge topping Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. In a small bowl, mix together brownie mix, 1 egg and water. Spread into the greased pan. Bake for 25 minutes. Melt the caramels with the evaporated milk over low heat in a heavy saucepan. Stir often, and heat until mixture has a smooth consistency. Reserve 1/3 cup of this caramel mixture, and pour the remainder over the warm, baked brownie crust. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla with an electric mixer until smooth. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Pour cream cheese mixture over caramel mixture. Bake cheesecake for 40 minutes. Chill in pan. When cake is thoroughly chilled, loosen by running a knife around the edge, and then remove the rim of the pan. Heat reserved caramel mixture, and spoon over cheesecake. Drizzle with the chocolate topping.
