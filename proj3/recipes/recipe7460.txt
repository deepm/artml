Recipe By:Tammy "This a very rich cake, but mmmmmmmm so good. Best eaten with milk or coffee. You can also make it a Chocolate Gooey Butter Cake if desired. Just use a chocolate cake mix in place of the yellow." Ingredients 3/8 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix 1-3/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon confectioners' sugar 3-1/2 ounces cream cheese Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter one 9x13 inch cake pan. Melt the butter slightly. Mix it with 2 of the eggs and cake mix. Pour batter into prepared pan. Mix the remaining 2 eggs with the cream cheese, and the confectioner's sugar. Pour this mixture evenly over the first mixture. Do not stir. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 minutes.
