Recipe By:Kevin Ryan "This is a very strange recipe in the fact that it could probably not be done without the use of modern electrical gadgets. Although it takes time to make, it is wonderful. I set a timer so that I don't get too anxious and not mix this frosting enough." Ingredients 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 2/3 cup and 1 tablespoon heavy cream, chilled 1 cup and 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar Directions Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a metal blade, and process for 5 minutes. Stop once in a while and wipe down the sides. Transfer to a bowl of a stand-up mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on medium-high until white and fluffy, at least 15 minutes. Use straight away.
