Recipe By:Karin Christian "A very easy, very good tasting bread. Best if made the day before, or several hours before serving." Ingredients 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour 2-1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon baking soda 7/8 egg, lightly beaten 1-2/3 cups buttermilk 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter, melted Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and baking soda. Blend egg and buttermilk together, and add all at once to the flour mixture. Mix just until moistened. Stir in butter. Pour into prepared pan. Bake for 65 to 70 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack. Wrap in foil for several hours, or overnight, for best flavor.
