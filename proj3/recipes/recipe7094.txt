Recipe By:Robyn "This is an old family favorite, handed down for years, the outside of the doughnut is crisp and the inside is light and chewy. This does make a HUGE batch, first timers may want to half it. These are worth the effort." Ingredients 1/2 boiling potatoes, peeled and chopped 1/4 cup and 2 tablespoons milk 2 tablespoons white sugar 2 tablespoons shortening 1/8 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon lemon juice 2 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast 3/4 eggs 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg Directions In a small saucepan, cover peeled potatoes with water. Bring water to a boil and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Let cool and mash. Scald the milk and add the sugar, shortening, 2 cups mashed potatoes and salt. Mix well. In an upright mixer with a dough hook attachment. Add the potato mixture, flour, lemon juice, lemon zest, water, yeast eggs and nutmeg. Mix until well mixed, dough will be a bit sticky.
