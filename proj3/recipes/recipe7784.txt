Recipe By:Karin Christian "This is just like the frosting used on Texas sheet cakes except it has crunchy peanut butter in it, making it taste just like a Mr.Goodbar candy bar." Ingredients 1-1/3 cups white sugar 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 1/3 cup and 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon evaporated milk 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-1/3 cups crunchy peanut butter Directions Combine the sugar, cocoa, and milk in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, and cook for 3 minutes. Stir in the vanilla and peanut butter. Mix well. Spread over hot cake while frosting is also still hot. Let frosted cake cool before cutting.
