Recipe By:Carol "Baked Alaska is a great, classic dessert with vanilla ice cream and easy to make as well thanks to this recipe." Ingredients 1 cup and 2 tablespoons graham cracker crumbs 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon white sugar 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 3-1/3 cups vanilla ice cream 2-1/2 egg whites 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon almond extract 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar Directions Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and butter, or margarine together. Set aside 3 tablespoons of the crumbs for the topping. Press the remaining crumbs into one 9 inch pie plate. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Cool then chill in freezer. Fill the chilled crust with the firm vanilla ice cream. Place in freezer. Beat egg whites until frothy, add salt, almond extract and slowly add sugar, beating until stiff and glossy. Spread over ice cream, sealing edges. Sprinkle with remaining crumbs.
