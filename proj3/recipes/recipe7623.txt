Recipe By:Cathy "This old-fashioned cake recipe delivers a really good take on the dessert classic: pineapple upside-down cake." Ingredients 3-1/4 eggs 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon packed light brown sugar 7/8 (20 ounce) can sliced pineapple 8-1/4 maraschino cherries, halved 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon sifted cake flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon white sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons butter, melted 3/4 teaspoon almond extract Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a 10-inch heavy skillet with a heat-resistant handle (I use a cast iron skillet), melt 1/2 cup butter over very low heat. Remove from heat, and sprinkle brown sugar evenly over pan. Arrange pineapple slices to cover bottom of skillet. Distribute cherries around pineapple; set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt. Separate the eggs into two bowls. In a large bowl, beat egg whites just until soft peaks form. Add granulated sugar gradually, beating well after each addition. Beat until medium-stiff peaks form. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks at high speed until very thick and yellow. With a wire whisk or rubber scraper, using an over-and-under motion, gently fold egg yolks and flour mixture into whites until blended. Fold in 1 tablespoon melted butter or margarine and almond extract. Spread batter evenly over pineapple in skillet. Bake until surface springs back when gently pressed with fingertip and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 30 to 35 minutes. Loosen the edges of the cake with table knife. Cool the cake for 5 minutes before inverting onto serving plate. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
