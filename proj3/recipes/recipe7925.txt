Recipe By:Judalee "This is an old family recipe. The cake has a delicate chocolate flavor and the icing is hard to the touch, yet creamy when bitten into." Ingredients 4-1/4 eggs 1-3/4 cups and 2 tablespoons white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon shortening 1-3/4 teaspoons baking soda 2 cups and 1 tablespoon cake flour 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon buttermilk 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 7/8 pinch salt 1-2/3 cups white sugar 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon heavy whipping cream 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter Directions Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9 inch round cake pans. Separate the eggs. Set the egg yolks aside and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form. Cream 2 1/'4 cups sugar, vanilla, and shortening. Add the egg yolks and beat till smooth. Sift together the cocoa, cake flour, baking soda, and salt. Then add dry ingredients alternately with buttermilk to creamy mixture. Lastly, fold in beaten egg whites. Pour into 3 greased and floured cake pans. Bake 20-25 minutes in 325 degree F (165 degrees C) oven, or until done. To Make Icing: Cook 2 cups white sugar, 1 cup cream and 1/2 cup butter or margarine over low flame until mixture forms a soft ball in water. Remove from heat, beat about 5 or 6 strokes to make mixture smooth. Cool, spread between and on layers while lukewarm. This hardens when cold.
