Recipe By:Carol "The traditional recipe for petits fours uses genoise for the cake base, but pound cake can also be used. Use this frosting to decorate on the base of your choice." Ingredients 1-1/4 cups white sugar 1-1/4 dashes cream of tartar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons water 1-1/4 drops red food coloring 1-1/4 drops green food coloring 1-1/4 drops yellow food coloring 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar Directions Combine sugar, cream of tartar, salt, and water in a small saucepan. Cook to the soft ball stage, 234 - 240 degrees F (112 - 115 degrees C). Cool to lukewarm. Gradually beat in enough confectioners' sugar to make mixture thick enough to almost hold its shape. Stir in flavoring. Divide into 4 parts. Leave one part white and tint other portions pink, yellow, and green. To ice petits fours, place them on a cooling rack and spoon the icing/frosting over the top until covered. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED Â© 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/30/2019
