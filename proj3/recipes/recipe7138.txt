Recipe By:IDAJ "Ciao! This is an old recipe, hence the enormous measurements. Makes enough for a huge Italian family! You can half the recipe; leave yeast and eggs the same. They are excellent with wine or coffee, and make good teething biscuits if you leave out the fennel seeds." Ingredients 1/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons water 1-1/4 teaspoons margarine 1/2 teaspoon white sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 egg 1/2 pound all-purpose flour, divided 2-1/2 teaspoons fennel seed 1-1/4 teaspoons water (optional) Directions In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in water. Let stand for 5 minutes. In a large bowl combine butter or margarine, sugar, salt, and egg. Add yeast mixture and 1/2 of the flour and mix until smooth. Stir in the remaining flour and the seeds. Mix in additional water as needed to make a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead well. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, and turn once to coat surface. Cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm spot to rise for about 1 1/2 hours. Roll dough into short ropes about 1/2 inch thick. Join ends to form donut shape. Set aside to rise for a few minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill a large saucepan half full of water; bring to a boil. Drop taralli into water and boil for 1 minute. Remove from water, letting both sides dry on a sheet of waxed paper. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) on a lightly greased cookie sheet, turning a few times during baking until medium brown and crisp.
