Ingredients 2 cups Herman Sourdough Starter 2 cups all-purpose flour 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 1-1/4 eggs, beaten 1/3 cup margarine 2/3 cup white sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon raisins (optional) 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon chopped walnuts (optional) Directions In a large bowl combine Herman Sweet Sourdough Starter, flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder and eggs until well blended. Knead dough in bowl for 5 to 7 minutes, or until mixture is smooth. Let rise in warm place until doubled. Punch down. On a lightly floured surface, press dough into a 10 x 20 inch rectangle. Combine melted margarine, sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Spread mixture over dough. Sprinkle with walnuts or raisins, if desired. Starting on long side, roll up dough, jellyroll fashion. Press ends together to make a seam. Cut in 1-inch slices and place in an ungreased, 11x14 inch cake pan. Allow rolls rise to double their size. Bake in a preheated 325 F oven (165 degree C) for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
