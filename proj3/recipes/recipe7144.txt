Recipe By:Bob "This is an old Slovak recipe. In Slovak it is called Roshky. The rolls are filled with lekvar, a thick, soft fruit spread. This is an all day project. This recipe will make 7 or 8 twelve inch loaves, or some dough may be reserved for lekvar squares." Ingredients 1/3 cup margarine 1 eggs 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1/3 cup sour cream 1/8 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons milk 2 cups all-purpose flour 3/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 2-1/2 ounces ground walnuts 2 tablespoons and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1-1/2 ounces apricot preserves 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons butter, melted 1/8 egg yolk Directions Prepare two fillings. Mix together walnuts, 1 cup sugar, and 1/ 8 teaspoon cinnamon. In a separate bowl, mix lekvar with lemon juice and 1/8 teaspoon cinnamon. In a large bowl, combine 1 cup sugar, 2 cups butter or margarine, and 6 eggs. Mix well. Add sour cream, milk, flour, yeast, and salt. Beat thoroughly until dough does not stick to hands. Form dough into 7 or 8 balls. Roll out each ball on a lightly floured board to a rectangle. Brush dough with melted butter. Fill with fillings. Roll tight. Place on greased pans, and let stand for approximately 4 hours to raise before baking. Brush tops with beaten egg yolk just before placing in oven. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.
