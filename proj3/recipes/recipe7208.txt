Recipe By:Jen "Granny's best bread recipe, ever! Try it for yourself!" Ingredients 2/3 cup rolled oats 2/3 cup boiling water 1/3 cup scalded whole milk 1 teaspoon canola oil 3 tablespoons and 1-3/4 teaspoons molasses 1 tablespoon and 2-1/4 teaspoons white sugar 1 teaspoon active dry yeast 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt Directions In a large bowl pour the boiling water over the rolled oats. Add the scalded milk and stir. Pour in the oil and molasses. Stir well. In a separate bowl mix the sugar with the yeast and 1 cup of the flour. When the oatmeal mixture has cooled to lukewarm add the yeast-flour mixture. Stir in the salt and remaining 5 cups of flour. Knead dough for 6 to 8 minutes. Place the dough in a covered greased bowl and let rise until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch the dough down. Knead for 2 minutes. Divide dough into two pieces and place into greased 9x5x3 inch loaf pans. Cover pans and let rise until almost doubled in size. Bake in a preheated 350 degree F (175 degrees C) oven for 1 hour, or until nicely browned. Let the loaves cool on a rack. Remove loaves from pan; wrap well and store in a cool spot.
