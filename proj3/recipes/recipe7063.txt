Recipe By:Nancy "Pretzels where the dough is mixed in the bread machine." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 1 tablespoon beer 1-3/4 teaspoons margarine 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon white sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1-2/3 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast 1/2 egg 1-3/4 teaspoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 1 tablespoon and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt Directions Measure first 6 ingredients in order listed into baking pan. Select: Dough/Pasta Setting and press start. When the cycle is complete remove dough to a lightly floured surface. If necessary, knead in enough flour to make dough easy to handle. Roll into a 14X9 inch rectangle. With a sharp knife, cut into eighteen 14X1/2 inch strips. Gently pull each strip into a rope 16 inches long. To shape into pretzels: Curve ends of each rope to make a circle; cross ends at top. Twist ends once and lay over bottom of circle. Place on greased baking sheets. DO NOT LET RISE. Combine lightly beaten egg and 1tablespoon water; brush on pretzels. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 18-20 minutes or until done. Remove from sheets and let pretzels cool on wire rack. Enjoy!
