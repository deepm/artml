Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon white sugar 1/4 cup and 1 tablespoon brown sugar 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons butter, softened 1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon milk 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 (1.4 ounce) bars chocolate covered toffee bars, chopped 3/8 egg 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon chopped, unsalted dry-roasted peanuts Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. Crush toffee bars into small bits and set aside. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, brown sugar and butter; mix on low speed with an electric mixer until crumbly. Remove 1/2 cup of crumb mixture and set aside to be used for topping. Add milk, baking powder, vanilla, egg, and 1/2 cup of the crushed toffee bars; beat at low speed until well-mixed. Increase speed to medium, and beat for 1 minute.
