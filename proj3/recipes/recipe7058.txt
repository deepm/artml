Recipe By:Julie "Old fashioned New England flavor using a bread machine! You can mix the bread in the machine then bake it in the regular oven using your favorite pans, I do." Ingredients 1 cup and 1 tablespoon water 2-2/3 cups bread flour 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon butter 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon dry milk powder 3 tablespoons and 1-3/4 teaspoons molasses 2 teaspoons active dry yeast 1-1/4 teaspoons salt Directions Place ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order suggested by the manufacturer. Select Dough or White Bread setting, and then Start. If the dough does not form a ball on the paddle, add 1 tablespoon of flour at a time until the ball forms. Allow machine to complete selected cycle. To bake conventionally, remove the dough from the bread machine pan after the Dough cycle has completed. Shape into a loaf, and place in a greased 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Let rise until doubled. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 40 minutes.
