Recipe By:re "Best Ever!" Ingredients 7/8 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast 1 cup and 1 tablespoon warm water (110 degrees F) 3/8 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix 2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour, divided 1-1/4 eggs 2 tablespoons and 3/4 teaspoon vegetable oil 1/2 teaspoon salt 3 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon butter, softened 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 2-1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons butter, melted 1-1/4 cups confectioners' sugar 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 cup and 1 teaspoon milk Directions In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water, and let stand for 3 minutes. Add cake mix, 1 cup flour, eggs, oil, and salt; beat well. Stir in remaining flour until a soft dough forms. Knead on well floured surface for about 5 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, and turn to coat the dough surface. Let rise until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Punch down, and divide into two equal parts. Roll out each section on a lightly floured surface. Spread each with softened butter and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Roll up like jelly rolls and cut buns 1 1/2 inches thick with a piece of dental floss or a dull knife. Place in greased baking pans, and allow to rise until doubled. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 to 35 minutes or until golden brown. Meanwhile, combine confectioners sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, vanilla, and milk. Remove baked buns from oven and drizzle with frosting. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
