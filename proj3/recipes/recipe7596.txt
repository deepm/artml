Recipe By:Alyssa Peters "This recipe was originated by one of my mom's friends, who made it totally from scratch one night at a homeless shelter, when they ran out of ingredients. They used whatever they had. It was served, and the people loved it! This recipe has been passed around ever since! It's a delicious cake that people go ga-ga over! It's best when made the day before. Frost with whipped topping and serve with fresh fruit." Ingredients 1/2 (18.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix 2-1/4 cups ricotta cheese 2-1/4 eggs 2-1/4 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 (16 ounce) package frozen whipped topping, thawed Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
