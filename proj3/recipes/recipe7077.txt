Recipe By:Sandy Speer "This is wonderful with spaghetti, lasagna, or another Italian dish, but my family likes it with almost anything. It's very good if made the day before you need it, then split down the middle, buttered, and reheated at mealtime. I use a bread machine, but it can be made without. I like to use the dough cycle, then bake it in a French loaf pan." Ingredients 3/4 cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C) 2 tablespoons and 1-1/2 teaspoons nonfat dry milk powder 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon and 2 teaspoons white sugar 1-1/4 teaspoons garlic salt 1-1/4 teaspoons onion powder 1-1/4 teaspoons dried basil 1-1/4 teaspoons dried dill weed 1-1/4 teaspoons celery seed 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon dried parsley 2-1/2 cups bread flour 1-3/4 teaspoons active dry yeast Directions For bread machine: Place all ingredients in bread pan as recommended by your manufacturer. Process on "Regular" or "White Bread" cycle. Remove promptly after baking cycle is complete. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED © 2019 Allrecipes.com Printed From Allrecipes.com 3/29/2019
