Recipe By:Carol "This is a lovely sponge cake that is reminiscent of the Deep South. May be cut into layers and filled and iced with lemon filling, or with whipped cream." Ingredients 1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons cold water 2-1/2 egg yolks 2-1/2 egg whites 1-1/4 cups white sugar 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 1-1/3 cups and 2 tablespoons sifted cake flour 3/4 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt Directions Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cold water and egg yolks together until mixture makes 1 quart--at least 10 minutes. Slowly add sugar and vanilla to egg yolk mixture, beating for at least 7 minutes more. Sift the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together. Fold into the egg yolk mixture. Beat egg whites until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold one third of the egg white mixture into the batter to lighten; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into an ungreased tube pan. Bake in preheated oven until cake springs back when lightly touched with a fingertip, about 50 minutes. Turn upside down to cool in pan for 1 hour. Loosen sides and coax from pan.
